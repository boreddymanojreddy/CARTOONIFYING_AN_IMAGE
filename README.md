# CARTOONIFYING AN IMAGE

In todayâ€™s era, we are surrounded by different types of photo manipulating filters in our mobile phones, 
apps etc. This can be done by using computer vision techniques. Computer vision has a wide variety of 
applications not only to reduce the human effort but also used for entertainment apps. In this project, we 
converted a normal photo into a pencil sketch and cartoon image using computer vision in python programming 
language. Here we used a library called OpenCV which provides infrastructure for computer vision 
applications. For this, we have installed some modules and filters like bilateral and edge mechanism to get an 
efficient output as cartoon image and pencil sketch. It is mainly aimed at real-time computer vision and image 
processing. It is used to perform different operations on images which transform them using different 
techniques. Color palette and edges are the two main things which makes the difference between a normal 
image and a cartoon image. Edge Detection is a very important area in Computer Vision. Edges can be defined 
as sudden changes (discontinuities) in an image and they can encode just as much information as pixels.

This project demonstrates how computer vision techniques can transform standard photos into pencil sketches and cartoon images using Python and the OpenCV library. OpenCV provides the necessary tools and infrastructure for such image processing tasks. The project involves installing specific modules and applying filters like bilateral filtering and edge detection to achieve the desired effects.

Key points include:

1)Objective: Convert normal photos into pencil sketches and cartoon images.

2)Tools Used: Python programming language and the OpenCV library.

3)Techniques Applied:

   A.Bilateral Filtering: Smooths images while preserving edges, useful for cartoon effects.

   B.Edge Detection: Identifies sudden changes in intensity to highlight edges, crucial for distinguishing features in sketches and cartoons.

4)Focus: Real-time image processing and transforming images using different techniques to create visually distinct results.

Edge detection plays a vital role by capturing significant changes in an image, which are essential for enhancing features in sketches and cartoons.
